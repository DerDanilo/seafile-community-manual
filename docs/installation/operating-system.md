Still in progress and may not be complete:

* CentOS 7 (latest)
* Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)
* Docker

## Operating Systems
### Debian
You can use Debian 9 *Stretch* 64-bit as operating system.  
The *64-bit PC Network installer* will be sufficiant. It can be obtained from [www.debian.org](https://www.debian.org/distrib/). 

### Ubuntu LTS
You can use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS *Xenial* 64-bit as operating system.  
The *64-bit PC Network installer* will be sufficiant. It can be obtained from [www.ubuntu.com](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads). 

### CentOS
You can use CentOS 7 64-bit as operating system.  
The *64-bit PC Network installer* will be sufficiant. It can be obtained from [www.centos.org](https://www.centos.org/download/). 

### Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)
You can use  Debian 9 *Raspbian* as operating system.   
We recommend to use the *Minimal image*. It can be obtained from [www.raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

### Docker (Linux & Windows)
You may also use the [offical docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/seafileltd/seafile/) of Seafile server. Aware of its designn problems which cause [security issues](https://forum.seafile.com/t/docker-migration/6732/4).  

There are also some 3rd Party Seafile Docker images that might work better:  
[foxel/seafile](https://hub.docker.com/r/foxel/seafile/) (webserver included in container, mariadb database in external container, docker-compose yaml available)  
[sunx/seafile](https://hub.docker.com/r/sunx/seafile/) (without webserver, SQLite DB, compiles seafile itself, docker-compose yaml available)  
You can find more on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

** BE AWARE of issues and security, even though the images were checked one time, NO ONE CAN CONFIRM their completion and correctness.**

## Storage
### Local Storage

* In this manual we will put the Seafile Server and configuration files in `/opt` and seafile_data in `/srv`
* `/srv` will contain all data in Seafile server and needs to be at least that data size plus some spare for deleted files (file versions)
* If you devide your disk(s) into several partitions or want to use several disks, 10 GiB will be enough for `/` (root)
* If you have 2+ GiB of memory, choose 2 GiB for swap, otherwise 1 GiB will be sufficiant

### NFS/iSCSI Storage
You can map NFS storage to `/srv` or setup a iSCSI target to `/srv`.

### Block Storage
For now the **CE Version** of Seafile Server **does not support** any **block storage**. Adding block storage to the CE version was [requested in the forum](https://forum.seafile.com/t/add-s3-custom-base-bucket-option-make-available-to-ce/) though.
